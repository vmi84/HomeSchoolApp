# Design Collaboration Guide for PETS_app

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to collaborating with designers on wireframes for the PETS_app project using Figma.

## Getting Started

1. Access the Figma project:
   - Create a new project called "PETS_app"
   - Share the project with the design team
   - Set up appropriate permissions for collaboration

## Using Figma for Wireframe Collaboration

This document outlines our approach to collaborating with designers on wireframes for the PETS_app project using Figma.

### Setting Up Figma

1. **Create a Figma Account**
   - Sign up for the free tier at [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com)
   - The free tier allows for up to 3 active projects and collaboration with 2 editors

2. **Create a Project Structure**
   - Create a new project called "PETS_app"
   - Set up frames for mobile (iPhone) and tablet layouts

3. **Invite Team Members**
   - Invite developers and designers to the project
   - Set appropriate permissions (Edit or View)

### Wireframe Requirements

Our wireframes should clearly demonstrate the four main tabs of the application:

1. **Learning Compass (Profile)**
   - Student profile section
   - Subject tracking components
   - Learning goals interface
   - Progress statistics

2. **Resource Nexus (Resources)**
   - Resource browsing interface
   - API integration touchpoints (Khan Academy, Google Maps)
   - Tutoring section layout
   - Social insights display

3. **HomeLink (Connections)**
   - Community discovery interface
   - Event browsing components
   - Tutor connection screens
   - Social feed layout

4. **GrowEasy Analytics (Progress)**
   - Progress overview cards
   - Subject-by-subject progress tracking
   - Achievement displays
   - Insight components

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Initial Wireframes**
   - Designer creates low-fidelity wireframes for core screens
   - Team reviews and provides feedback using Figma comments

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Designer updates wireframes based on feedback
   - Weekly design review meetings to discuss progress

3. **Developer Implementation**
   - Developers use finalized wireframes to implement UI
   - Regular check-ins to ensure design fidelity

4. **Design System Development**
   - Create a shared component library for consistent UI elements
   - Document color schemes, typography, and spacing

### Using CursorAI with Figma

When you need implementation guidance based on Figma designs:

1. Export screens or components from Figma as PNG/JPG
2. Ask CursorAI: "Suggest a simple SwiftUI layout based on this Figma wireframe [paste link or attach image]"
3. Provide additional context about specific components if needed

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Components Organized**
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Group related elements
   - Create reusable components

2. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Document design decisions
   - Note any platform-specific adaptations
   - Create a design-to-code mapping guide

3. **Version Control**
   - Use Figma's version history
   - Create named versions after major revisions
   - Document changes between versions

### Design Review Checklist

- [ ] Does the design follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines?
- [ ] Are the primary user flows clear and intuitive?
- [ ] Do the designs accommodate various content lengths?
- [ ] Are accessibility considerations addressed?
- [ ] Is the design consistent across all screens?
- [ ] Are interactive elements properly indicated?
- [ ] Does the design scale appropriately for different device sizes?
